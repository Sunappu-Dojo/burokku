# Unused fonts

Unused fonts have their dedicated folder so they can easily be excluded from the `size-limit` report (see [config](../../../../.size-limit.json)).

If one of this file becomes needed, it should be moved at the [root of `fonts`](..) instead of being directly referenced from [`fonts/unused`](.).
