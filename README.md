# Hatena Burokku

_トゲハテナブロック_ (_hatena burokku_) is Japanese for [_interrogation block_ ⍰](https://www.mariowiki.com/%3F_Block).

## Building the app

The app is in `/src`. Assets called by the app needs to be compiled using some front-end tooling, detailed below.

### Development

1. Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it.
2. Run `npm install` (Node > 12.13) to install all the required packages and tools.
3. Run `npm run dev` and open the URL returned by the CLI.

Note: the Service Worker is broken while developing. Ignore it and check it using the [production](#production) mode.

### Production

1. Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it.
2. Run `npm install` (Node > 14.18) to install all the required packages and tools.
3. Run `npm run build` to compile the app. The compiled app goes in `/public`.
4. Run `npm run preview` to preview it on your machine.

### Various

- Files in `/src/public` are copied as is (respecting the directory structure in `/src/public`) in the build directory.
- Lint JavaScript: `npm run lint` to scan for errors or `npm run lint-fix` to try an automatic fix.

## Some audio operations with ffmpeg

When adding a new block, sounds must be provided [in FLAC and WAV](#convert-wav-to-flac) (WAV is the fallback). Then, their [volume needs to be adjusted](#sounds-normalization).

### Convert WAV to FLAC

`ffmpeg -i my-sound.wav -c:a flac my-sound.flac`

### Sounds normalization

Normalizing sounds means (in our case, but [there is](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/AudioVolume) [more](https://superuser.com/questions/323119/how-can-i-normalize-audio-using-ffmpeg/323127#323127)) aligning the maximum volume of several sounds, so that there’s no sound effect sounding too loud or too quiet compared to the others.

First, run `ffmpeg -i my-sound.wav -filter:a volumedetect -f null /dev/null` to detect the volume profile ([official doc](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#volumedetect)) on your audio files. The audio profile of a file could be:

```
[Parsed_volumedetect_0 @xxx] mean_volume: -19.3 dB
[Parsed_volumedetect_0 @xxx] max_volume: -2.7 dB
[Parsed_volumedetect_0 @xxx] histogram_2db: 2
[Parsed_volumedetect_0 @xxx] histogram_3db: 8
```

Among your files, the loudest will have its `max_volume` closer to 0 dB. You can normalize to whatever file you want by running a command on each audio file in order to increase or decrease their volume by a few dB.

If the audio file sounds too loud (`max_volume: -2.7 dB`), we can normalize it to another one having (for example) `max_volume: -8 dB`. The gap between the 2 files is 6 dB (5.3 dB rounded to the upper integer), so we’ll decrease the loudest file by 6 dB by running:

`ffmpeg -i my-sound.wav -filter:a "volume=-6dB" my-sound-normalized.wav`
